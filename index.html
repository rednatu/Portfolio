                <p>I am interested in dabbling with digital creation and because of this I love graphics design and that is why I had a good time learning HTML and CSS and a little bit of javascript. My career plan is doing commision or freelancing jobs in website development and graphics design to use it as a experience gathering platform and develop my skill set in the technical path and understanding the market. And along with that I hope to connect with peers of like-minds and work together on something related to digital creation.
